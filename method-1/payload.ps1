# What this could do instead of just opening the calculator:
# Download an exe and run it
# Download an exe and replace another exe with it, so that the next time that program is run it runs the payload
# Copy all of a user's sensitive data to a folder, zip it, and send that zip to a server
# Edit the startup of powershell to download and run a script, so that the attacker can run an updated info-stealer every time powershell is launched
# Almost anything else you can think of
